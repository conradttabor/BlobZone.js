# BlobZone.js

BlobZone.js is a modular drag and drop upload tool that can upload directly to an Azure Blob from the client side. 
Simply drop the file into the drop area and it can upload a file of significant size (I haven't tested how big you can get yet, but it's in gigs) and watch the progress bar keep you up to date on its state.

As I have time, I will update this readme with implementation instructions and more details about the project.
